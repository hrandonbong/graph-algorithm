# Graph-Algorithm
Welcome, this is a file utilizing dijkstra's algorithm, depth first search, and breadth-first search. It can help
with finding shortest paths to finding a path to a certain graph location. In a real world example, finding flights to 
certain cities using the shortest distance can be used. 

##Installation
Please see the appropriate guide for your environment of choice:
- Python 3.7+

##d_graph.py
This file is the directed graph with dijkstra's algorithm, depth-first search, and breadth-first search.

##ud_graph.py
This file has depth-first search, breadth-first search, and has a function that lets users know if their graph
contains a cycle.
